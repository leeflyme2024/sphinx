Usage:
        mmc extcsd read <device>
                Print extcsd data from <device>.
        mmc writeprotect boot get <device>
                Print the boot partitions write protect status for <device>.
        mmc writeprotect boot set <device>
                Set the boot partitions write protect status for <device>.
                This sets the eMMC boot partitions to be write-protected until
                the next boot.
        mmc writeprotect user set <type><start block><blocks><device>
                Set the write protect configuration for the specified region
                of the user area for <device>.
                <type> must be "none|temp|pwron".
                    "none"  - Clear temporary write protection.
                    "temp"  - Set temporary write protection.
                    "pwron" - Set write protection until the next poweron.
                <start block> specifies the first block of the protected area.
                <blocks> specifies the size of the protected area in blocks.
                NOTE! The area must start and end on Write Protect Group
                boundries, Use the "writeprotect user get" command to get the
                Write Protect Group size.
        mmc writeprotect user get <device>

                NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable (unreversible) change.
                To set enhanced attribute to general partition being created set
                 <enh_attr> to 1 else set it to 0.

                Disable the boot partition for the <device> if <boot_partition> is set to 0.
                To receive acknowledgment of boot from the card set <send_ack>
                to 1, else set it to 0.

        mmc rpmb write-key <rpmb device> <key file>
                Program authentication key which is 32 bytes length and stored
                in the specified file. Also you can specify '-' instead of
                key file path to read the key from stdin.
                NOTE!  This is a one-time programmable (unreversible) change.
                Example:
                  $ echo -n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH | \
                    mmc rpmb write-key /dev/mmcblk0rpmb -

        mmc rpmb read-block <rpmb device> <address> <blocks count> <output file> [key file]
                Blocks of 256 bytes will be read from <rpmb device> to output
                file or stdout if '-' is specified. If key is specified - read
                data will be verified. Instead of regular path you can specify
                '-' to read key from stdin.
                Example:
                  $ echo -n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH | \
                    mmc rpmb read-block /dev/mmcblk0rpmb 0x02 2 /tmp/block -
                or read two blocks without verification
                  $ mmc rpmb read-block /dev/mmcblk0rpmb 0x02 2 /tmp/block
        mmc rpmb write-block <rpmb device> <address> <256 byte data file> <key file>
                Block of 256 bytes will be written from data file to
                <rpmb device>. Also you can specify '-' instead of key
                file path or data file to read the data from stdin.
                Example:
                  $ (awk 'BEGIN {while (c++<256) printf "a"}' | \
                    echo -n AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH) | \

                Disable the eMMC cache feature on <device>.

        mmc csd read <device path>
                Print CSD data from <device path>.
                The device path should specify the csd file directory.

                Print CID data from <device path>.
                The device path should specify the cid file directory.

                Print SCR data from <device path>.
                The device path should specify the scr file directory.
